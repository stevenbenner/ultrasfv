## Welcome to UltraSFV.com

UltraSFV is a free file verification utility for Microsoft Windows and may be the most user-friendly file validation program out there. It is built as a stand-alone Windows application that will let you check file integrity using MD5 hashes or the more common CRC-32 checksums that are often included as .sfv files or embedded in file names.

**UltraSFV is currently in Beta. Only accepted beta testers can download it.**

### Quick Introduction

CRC stands for Cyclic Redundancy Check, and is a method used to check files for corruption that may occur when transferred over unreliable channels, such as over the internet, LAN or when burning to CD/DVD media. SFV, or Simple File Verification, is the implementation of 32-bit CRCs for checking whole files.

This method of error detection is particularly good at detecting common errors caused by packet loss or corruption in transmission channels and has become very popular for checking files for such corruption and errors.

MD5 on the other hand is an even more accurate mechanism for verifying files. MD5 isn't quite as ubiquitous as CRCs but it is a powerful algorithm that can securely validate that a file has not been corrupted or altered by a malicious individual. MD5 is usually used when you need to be sure that a file hasn't been modified by a hacker or virus.

UltraSFV is an application that gives you a suite of tools for creating and validating these file checksums.
