## About UltraSFV

UltraSFV is a free file verification utility that gives you an easy way to check files for damage, corruption or tampering that may occur when a file is transferred through unreliable channels, such as over the internet or LAN. This simple Windows tool will allow you to make sure your valuable data remains in perfect condition, no matter where you send it or how it is transferred.

### Features

UltraSFV includes a wide array of featues that many file verification application don't have. It is designed to make file checking faster, smarter and simpler. With smart hash searching, simple file browsing and support for <acronym title="Cyclic Redundancy Check">CRC</acronym>, <acronym title="Simple File Verification">SFV</acronym> and <acronym title=" Message-Digest Algorithm 5">MD5</acronym> file formats all you of your file validation tasks are managed by one simple tool.

* **File Name CRC Processing**

	File checking just got even simpler. With UltraSFV you don't even need SFV files, it can detect CRCs within file names. Just make sure you append CRCs to the names of any files you want to be able to be able to CRC verify in the future.

* **Smart Checksum Searching**

	If you want to check just one file in a collection most other software packages will choke or outright refuse, but not UltraSFV. When you select a file that you want to check for errors UltraSFV will scan the directory for any checksums referencing that file.

* **Directory Checking**

	UltraSFV can check whole directories, and even recursivly check whole groups of directories. When it finds an SFV file it will use the SFV values, otherwise it will try to extract CRCs from file names.

* **Drag and Drop Support**

	UltraSFV supports drag and drop file checking. Just drag the files you want to check into the main window and it will automatically begin proceesing those files.

* **Automatic Updating**

	You don't have to worry about keeping your UltraSFV install up to date. With built in automatic updating, UltraSFV can detect when a new version is released and prompt you to download the patch. The program will then patch itself and give you the newest features and latest fixes.

* **Highly Configurable**

	You can configure much of the functionality and customize your view to your liking.

* **Integrated Help**

	UltraSFV provides you with information about its features when you mouse over them. It also includes a full reference for general help and usage.

* **Error Reporting**

	All programs have bugs, it's just a fact of life. However UltraSFV gives you the ability to report errors and crashes to the developer. When an error is detected it is logged to a file, then the UltraSFV Error Reporting Utility opens allowing you to write a description of what you were doing when the error occurred. Just click send and your error report and the error log will be sent off.

### Easy To Use

From the very beginning UltraSFV has been designed to be user friendly and intuitive. When you start the application you will be greeted by a small, simple Windows interface with all of the functions presented in a familiar menu system. You can begin file operations by opening files using the menus, dragging and dropping, or just double clicking on checksum files.

Verifying files is as easy as double-clicking on a checksum file, or dragging the files you want to check into the UltraSFV window. If a file has a CRC embedded in its file name UltraSFV will automatically understand what it needs to do. Otherwise UltraSFV will search the directory for checksum files and try to match the file name.

Creating checksums is just as easy. You can append CRCs or create checksum files by simply selecting the files you want to lock in the file dialog. It really is that simple. You don't have to type commands or setup file associations.

With automatic updates, you never have to worry about outdated software. New releases can be automatically downloaded and installed with just one click.

And of course, the rarest feature, almost unheard of with file checkers, documentation. A lot of time has been spent documenting the program. Simple step-by-step instructions are included with the software to help you use the program to its fullest. All of this information is also available online through this web site.
