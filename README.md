# [UltraSFV](http://www.ultrasfv.com/) - Ultra Simple File Verification

A simple file verification tool for Windows that lets you validate CRC32 and MD5 file checksums.

## Project Status

I'm still polishing the application. There is currently no stable version released to the public.

## Introduction

UltraSFV is a free file checker utility for Microsoft Windows systems. It lets you validate CRC32 and MD5 checksums on files that you have downloaded or otherwise transferred over unreliable or unsecure channels.

It is designed to be light weight and user friendly. Everything is done through a simple native Windows GUI or Windows Explorer integration. The application itself is based off of .NET so it runs natively on any Windows computer that has .NET installed (which is basically any version of Windows after 98).

## Project History

This project was actually started in 2008. I had just begun using Network Attached Storage systems at home and was having terribly annoying LAN corruption issues because of a couple crappy NICs. So I needed a tool to verify the integrity of files after they had been transferred over the network. I tried several different file verification utilities and found them all wanting. So I decided to make my own.

I got the project to the point where all of the functionality that I needed was working perfectly and started using it regularly, but never reseased it. Of course I began the project with every intention of releasing it as a freeware utility for other people, but unfortunately I never had the time to finish polishing it to the point where it was ready for a full public release, and so it sat.

Well after 5 years of, let's call it "development", the UltraSFV project is back. I'm going to polish out the last few features that kept me from releasing it and then set it free.
