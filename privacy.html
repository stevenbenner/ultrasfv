				<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
				<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information collected by UltraSFV.com, its principal owners and operators ("USFV") through this website ("Site"). Although this Site provides links to third-party websites, they are not covered by this Privacy Policy. USFV assumes no responsibility for the privacy or security of information you provide to any third party through linked websites or any other means.</p>
				<p>By using this Site, you agree that you have reviewed and understood this Privacy Policy to your full satisfaction, that you accept and are subject to this Privacy Policy, and that USFV is permitted to use your information as set forth below.</p>
				<h3>Personally Identification Information</h3>
				<p>We may request personally identification information from you in connection with your use of, or participation in, membership registration for forums, surveys, subscription registrations, content submissions, chats, bulletin boards, discussion groups, requests for suggestions, and in connection with other activities, services or resources we make available on this Site. In all of these cases, we will collect personal identification information from you only if you voluntarily submit such information to us. We will never intentionally disclose any personal identification information about you as an individual user (such as, for example, your full name, street address, telephone number or e-mail address) to any third party without having received your permission. If you do provide us with personal information for any of these activities, we may use it to conduct the activity. We may also use cookie technology (discussed in detail below) to improve your experience of these activities, including remembering your preferences, customizing the content and advertisements that you see or authenticate your access to your personal information. In addition, in the event that your personally identifiable information is requested as part of our surveys or polls, such personally identifiable information may be added to your registration information.</p>
				<p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your information and password. You shall be responsible for all uses of your registration, whether or not authorized by you. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your registration or password.</p>
				<h3>Non-Personally Identification Information</h3>
				<p>If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the Site, read pages, or download information, USFV will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. This information does not identify you personally. USFV automatically collects and stores only the following information about your visit:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are connected to the internet) from which you access this Site;</li>
					<li>The type of browser and operating system used to access this Site;</li>
					<li>The date and time you access this Site;</li>
					<li>The pages you visit; and</li>
					<li>If you linked to this Site from another website, the address of that website. USFV uses the information we collect to count the number and type of visitors to the different pages on this Site, and to help USFV make the Site more useful to visitors like you.</li>
