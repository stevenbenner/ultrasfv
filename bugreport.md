## Report a Bug

Have you found a problem with UltraSFV? Then please report it! Bugs that don't get reported usually don't get fixed. However, you do need to put some thought into writing a bug report.

### Latest Version

Before you report a bug, please make sure you have the latest version. Use the Check for Updates feature to make sure you have the current version of the software. Open UltraSFV, go to the Tools menu and click Check for Updates.

### Program Errors or Crashes

If you are having issues with the program giving you error messages or crashing then please be sure to use the error reporting feature. This is absolutely vital for helping to improve UltraSFV. Sending an error report will send the error log and your comment to the developer with some basic system information. Please be as descriptive and accurate as possible when you send the error report.

### Bug Report Information

When reporting issues plase include what you did, what you expected to happen, and what actually happened. This is the absolute minimum of information required to be able to diagnose a problem. Simply stating that "this feature didn't work" is not going to help get the bug fixed. A bug report should state exactly how to reproduce the problem.

### Where to Report It

If you would like to report a problem, request a new feature, suggest improvements, or just ask a question then please [open a new issue](https://github.com/stevenbenner/ultrasfv/issues/new) on GitHub.
